# Chat GPT Price Calculator

The ChatGPT Price Calculator is a Python-based tool that estimates the cost of generating text using OpenAI's GPT language models based on the number of tokens and the chosen model. Users can compare the cost and number of tokens for each available model, and estimate the cost for a particular query using a file to get the large file. The tool does not require an OpenAI API key to use and provides a convenient way to estimate costs for generating text.
